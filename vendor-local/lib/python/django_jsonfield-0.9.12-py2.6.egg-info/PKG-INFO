        I had a serious need for a JSON field for django. There were a couple out
        there, but none packaged up nicely on bitbucket/github that were usable
        with ``pip install -e``.
        
        So I took the code from `David Cramer's blog`_, and packaged it up.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To use, just install the package, and then use the field::
        
            from django.db import models
            import jsonfield
            
            class MyModel(models.Model):
                the_json = jsonfield.JSONField()
            
        Now, it will validate the JSON on entry, and store it as a string in the
        database.  When you instantiate/fetch the object, it will be turned back
        into a python list/dict/string.
        
        There is also a ``TypedJSONField``, that allows you to define data types that must be included within each object in the array. More documentation to follow.
        
        
        Notes
        ~~~~~
        
        If no ``default`` is provided, and ``null=True`` is not passed in to the
        field constructor, then a default of ``{}`` will be used.
        
        There are also a couple of other bits and bobs:
        
        Extras
        ------
        
        jsonify templatetag
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        This allows you to convert a python data structure into JSON within a template::
        
            {% load jsonify %}
            
            <script>
            var foo = {{ bar|jsonify }};
            </script>
          
        History
        ----------
        
        0.9.12
        ~~~~~~
        Cache the result of db_type.
        Handle incoming data from multiple select widget better.
        
        0.9.9
        ~~~~~
        Finally strip out non-required files.
        
        0.9.8
        ~~~~~
        Remove freezegun workarounds.
        Fix broken build.
        
        0.9.4
        ~~~~~
        Fixes for mutable defaults: we serialize and then deserialize in this
        case, so you can still use ``default={}``.
        
        0.9.3
        ~~~~~
        Remove support for storing data using Postgres' 9.2's JSON data type, as
        you cannot currently query against this!
        
        Remove support for django < 1.3.
        
        
        0.9.0
        ~~~~~
        Add LICENSE file.
        Added TypedJSONField.
        
         
        0.8.10
        ~~~~~~
        Allow ``{{ variable|jsonify }}`` to work with querysets.
        
        0.8.8
        ~~~~~
        Prevent circular import problem with django 1.3.1 and gargoyle.
        
        0.8.7
        ~~~~~
        Better handle null=True and blank=True: it should make sense what they do now.
        
        0.8.5
        ~~~~~
        Allow for '{}' and '[]', and make them not appear to be None.
        
        0.8.4
        ~~~~~
        Ensure the version number file is installed with the package.
        
        0.8.3
        ~~~~~
        Store the version number in one place only, now.
        
        0.8.2
        ~~~~~
        Oops. Packaging error prevented install from pypi. Added README.rst to manifest.
        
        0.8.1
        ~~~~~
        Converting to string does nothing, as serializing a model instance with a JSONField would have a string version of that field, instead of it embedded inline. (Back to pre 0.8 behaviour).
        
        Added better querying support: (``field__contains={'key':'value','key2':'value2'}`` works.)
        
        Removed JSONTableWidget from package.
        
        0.8
        ~~~
        (Many thanks to `IanLewis`_ for these features)
        
        Supports django 1.2
        
        Supports callable and json serializable objects as default
        
        Implemented get_db_prep_value()
        
        Add tests and test runner.
        
        Removed JSONTableWidget from README.
        
        0.7.1
        ~~~~~
        Don't fail when trying to install before django is installed.
        
        0.7
        ~~~
        First time I tagged releases.
        
        
        Todo
        ----------
        Allow for passing in a function to use for processing unknown data types.
        
        Convert date/time objects nicely to/from ISO strings (YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS 
        TZNAME). This is actually a bit tricky, as we don't know if we are expecting
        a date/time object. We may parse objects as we go, but there could be
        some performance issues with this. I'm tempted to say "only do this on TypedJSONField()"
